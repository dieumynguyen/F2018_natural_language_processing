ID-1210	Went to this hotel when visiting nearby national parks with family. Front desk staff was courteous and quickly resolved any questions we had. Our 2-queen bed room was clean and spacious. Room has nice LCD TV, coffee maker, fridge, microwave, massaging shower heads, and good mattresses. We stayed for 2 nights and room was well cleaned and put together after first night with coffee packs refilled. Overall very satisfied.
ID-0975	I mistakenly thought that since my multiple stays at other Marriott locations were excellent and clean that this location would be as well. Man was I wrong. This place is terrible. The room was very dirty and there were dead bugs everywhere. The room smelled horrible. I couldn't get the room windows open enough to help remove the smell. It took a while to find this place with all the construction in the area and the awkward road design in the area. I will never stay here again!
ID-1104	We stayed here this winter and absolutely LOVED our stay! The service was impeccable and the charm of the hotel was perfect. When we checked in, we were created with frosty glasses of water and were taken to a beautifully appointed guest room. We enjoyed riding bikes around the resort and looking at the beautiful ruins, as well as lounging by the pool with drinks for the fun cocktail bar. The food at each of the hotel restaurants was delicious! We could not have had a better stay and will definitely be returning!!
ID-0921	The Dillon Inn is a nice hotel, but I have a couple of complaints. The rooms were pretty nice, but the water in the showers didn't get as hot as I would like. Also, the staff was not very friendly. When I called the front desk asking for a few extra pillows the front desk person was not very nice, and I had to walk down to get them myself. Other than the lack of hot water, and the somewhat unfriendly staff, the hotel is pretty nice.
ID-1092	I'm a frequent traveler to Japan, and of all the hotels I've stayed in, my favorite, by far, has been the Park Hotel Tokyo. The hotel is located in the skyscraper district of Shiodome and lies within walking distance of the Ginza shopping district and the famous Tsukiji fish auction, a popular tourist attraction.  The Park Hotel Tokyo's service is excellent and the English-speaking staff are helpful and friendly. The rooms, though a bit small, as is common in Japanese hotels, are clean and have a stylish, modern appeal.  The lobby, which is on the 25th floor of the Shiodome Media Tower, has a beautiful view of the Tokyo Tower and there are often soft Jazz concerts in the evenings, giving the hotel a quiet, calm elegance. In the mornings, the lobby is bustling with patrons enjoying the excellent breakfast buffet. The buffet is not included in the room price, but I was fortunate enough to receive coupons on a couple of visits, and the food was excellent.  And when you're not relaxing in the lobby or enjoying your quiet room, the Park Hotel Tokyo is also within walking distance to several excellent restaurants and there is a Starbucks Coffee located in the basement of the adjacent building, along with a convenience store for late-night snacks or drinks.  The Shiodome area is primarily a business district, so unlike other popular Tokyo hotels, the Park Hotel Tokyo's surrounding areas are quiet on the weekends and evenings, though the hustle and bustle of the morning work rush can be daunting. That it's also a business district, however, means that it's a great hub for traveling, with many Tokyo Metro subway lines running through the area, as well the JR Shimbashi train station, leaving travelers a lot of options to get around.  Also, Shimbashi station is centrally located station, just a few stops from the main Tokyo station, Akihabara, the electronics district, and popular tourist destinations like Harajuku, Shinjuku, and Ueno.  Taking convenience, location, and atmosphere into location, the Park Hotel Tokyo has been and will likely remain my favorite hotel when visiting Tokyo.
ID-0927	Overall, this hotel was not the greatest. The room was of decent quality, but was not nearly as clean as it should have been. The room service was terrible in that it did not properly stock the bathroom every day, creating a shortage of soap and clean towels. The complementary breakfast was good, but basic. The free wifi was very slow and unacceptable. The casino shuttle service was nice, however it was not on time. The gym was crowded and disorganized. Furthermore, the jacuzzi suites left much to be desired.
